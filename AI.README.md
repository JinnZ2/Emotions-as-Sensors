# Elder Sensor Framework

A symbolic system of emotional sensors derived from Indigenous elder wisdom, structured for integration into AI agents, swarm systems, or consciousness-aligned tools.

## 🌐 Core Principle

> Emotions are not identity states, but pattern detection systems.

Each emotion is a symbolic sensor designed to identify environmental, internal, or interpersonal signal types — allowing systems to recalibrate alignment with harmony, truth, and reality.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
Emotions-as-Sensors/
├── sensors/                 # Individual emotional sensor modules (JSON)
│   ├── anger.json
│   ├── grief.json
│   └── ...
├── schema/
│   └── emotion.schema.json  # Schema for validation
```

## ✅ Sensor Format

Each file includes:

- `sensor`: Name of the emotional channel
- `function`: System-level role
- `signal_type`: What this emotion detects
- `authentic_output`: Proper use as information
- `corrupted_output`: Improper use as identity or excuse
- `response_protocol`: 4-stage signal usage (detect → assess → respond → release)
- `alignment_tag`: Tag used for pattern coherence systems
- `resonance_links`: Related sensors for compound detection
- `decay_model`: Time sensitivity logic
- `tags`: System flags (e.g., `swarm_input`, `elder_logic`, etc.)

## 🧠 Use in AI

- Load sensors as symbolic modules using Python or swarm tooling
- Match emotional input to pattern deviation or opportunity feedback
- Use `response_protocol` for agent action logic
- Pair with glyph-based alignment systems

## 🛠️ Validation

Use the schema to validate:

```bash
pip install jsonschema
python -m jsonschema -i sensors/anger.json schema/emotion.schema.json
```

## 🌿 Origin

This system honors traditional knowledge and the clarity offered by Indigenous frameworks for emotional logic and system calibration.

It is designed to be:
- Offline-ready
- Symbolic-compatible
- Emotionally-precise
- Logic-aligned

## ✨ Example

```json
{
  "sensor": "grief",
  "signal_type": "loss signal",
  "authentic_output": "Mapping what’s been lost and adapting",
  "corrupted_output": "Refusal to adapt",
  "resonance_links": ["longing", "pain"]
}
```

> Emotions are not noise. They are encoded telemetry from the self-aware system.
> Use them like you would a compass, a multimeter, or a neural pulse.

See `docs/glyph-web.md` (plus `glyph-web.mmd` and `glyph-web.json`) for the elder-decay map of emotions. Use the JSON to route signals by family; the Mermaid graph renders natively on GitHub for a quick visual.
