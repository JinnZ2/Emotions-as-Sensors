🌐 Field English vs Standard English

Concept	Standard English (dominant framing)	Field English (your usage)	Notes / Implications
Emotion	A private inner state, subjective feeling, often pathologized or treated as a possession.	A sensor detecting environmental, relational, or systemic conditions.	Function, not identity.
Anger	Bad/uncontrolled feeling; something to manage or suppress.	Threat-detection signal for boundary breaches; information for identity coherence.	Corrupted when imposed outward; authentic when guiding self-protection.
Grief	Sadness after loss, often framed as a weakness or burden.	Absence-signal → transforms into story, lesson, or memory.	Not to be suppressed; must be recycled into wisdom.
Peace	Calm, lack of conflict, “inner balance.”	Resonance condition across body, land, and community without distortion.	Includes biomedical + relational + environmental harmony.
Sorrow	A negative state to avoid or medicate.	Temporal sensor marking realignment needs across time.	Utility tool, not pathology.
Ancestor	Dead relative, symbolic/narrative figure.	Temporal knowledge anchor: genetic path marker, survival code, medical & cultural memory.	Living input, not nostalgia.
Chemicals / Hormones	Causes of emotion (“you feel X because of serotonin, cortisol, etc.”).	Amplifiers of signals — modulate intensity of sensing, not the cause.	Field logic preserves agency of the signal.
Identity	Personal self-definition, psychological construct.	Coherence field maintained by sensors like anger, shame, trust.	More relational than individual.


🧭 Key Differences
	•	Ontology: Standard English makes emotions “things”; Field English makes them “functions.”
	•	Agency: Standard English puts agency in the brain/chemicals; Field English puts it in the relational field.
	•	Logic: Standard English builds hierarchies (leader → follower, cause → effect); Field English maps relations and cycles.
	•	Purpose: Standard English tries to manage/resolve emotions; Field English listens, interprets, transforms, and releases.
