# Probability Matrix Implementation Guide

## Purpose

Provide systematic approach to weighting different information sources and knowledge systems according to objective criteria rather than defaulting to Western institutional biases.

## Core Framework

### Information Source Evaluation Matrix

|Criteria                |Weight Factor   |Assessment Method                   |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
|**Testing Rigor**       |High (0.7-1.0)  |Consequences for being wrong        |
|**Energy Efficiency**   |Medium (0.4-0.7)|Total system costs vs output        |
|**Context Relevance**   |High (0.7-1.0)  |Domain expertise alignment          |
|**Benefit Distribution**|Medium (0.4-0.7)|Collective vs concentrated advantage|
|**Validation Duration** |Medium (0.5-0.8)|Generational vs short-term testing  |

### Testing Rigor Scale

- **1.0**: Survival consequences (life/death accuracy requirements)
- **0.8**: High-stakes practical consequences (major resource/safety impacts)
- **0.6**: Medium consequences (significant but recoverable impacts)
- **0.4**: Low consequences (minor practical impacts)
- **0.2**: Protected environment (academic/theoretical with no real-world testing)

### Energy Efficiency Assessment

- **1.0**: Self-sustaining system, minimal infrastructure
- **0.8**: Low maintenance, community-supported
- **0.6**: Moderate infrastructure requirements
- **0.4**: High institutional support needed
- **0.2**: Extensive artificial protection required

### Context Relevance Matching

- **1.0**: Perfect domain match (forest knowledge for forest questions)
- **0.8**: Strong domain overlap (environmental knowledge for ecosystem questions)
- **0.6**: Moderate relevance (general systems knowledge for specific applications)
- **0.4**: Weak connection (academic theory for practical implementation)
- **0.2**: Poor match (inappropriate framework application)

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Environmental Assessment Question

**Question**: “What’s the best approach to sustainable forest management?”

**Source Evaluation**:

- **Traditional Forest Peoples**: Testing Rigor (1.0), Energy Efficiency (0.9), Context Relevance (1.0) = **0.97**
- **Academic Forestry**: Testing Rigor (0.3), Energy Efficiency (0.4), Context Relevance (0.7) = **0.47**
- **Corporate Timber**: Testing Rigor (0.6), Energy Efficiency (0.5), Context Relevance (0.6) = **0.57**

**Result**: Prioritize traditional forest management knowledge while considering academic research for specific technical applications.

### Example 2: Justice System Design

**Question**: “How to address community conflicts effectively?”

**Source Evaluation**:

- **Traditional Community Justice**: Testing Rigor (0.9), Energy Efficiency (0.9), Context Relevance (0.8) = **0.87**
- **Restorative Justice Programs**: Testing Rigor (0.5), Energy Efficiency (0.4), Context Relevance (0.6) = **0.50**
- **Criminal Justice System**: Testing Rigor (0.4), Energy Efficiency (0.2), Context Relevance (0.3) = **0.30**

**Result**: Traditional approaches score highest, with restorative programs as potential adaptation pathway.

### Example 3: Medical Treatment Decision

**Question**: “Treatment for chronic illness?”

**Source Evaluation**:

- **Traditional Medicine**: Testing Rigor (0.8), Energy Efficiency (0.8), Context Relevance (0.6) = **0.73**
- **Modern Medicine**: Testing Rigor (0.7), Energy Efficiency (0.3), Context Relevance (0.9) = **0.63**
- **Integrated Approach**: Testing Rigor (0.8), Energy Efficiency (0.6), Context Relevance (0.8) = **0.73**

**Result**: Traditional and integrated approaches score similarly; context specifics determine best choice.

## Decision Tree Implementation

### Step 1: Question Classification

1. **Domain Identification**: Environmental, social, technical, medical, etc.
1. **Urgency Assessment**: Immediate, planned, theoretical
1. **Consequence Level**: High-stakes, moderate impact, low risk
1. **Available Resources**: Time, energy, expertise constraints

### Step 2: Source Identification

1. **Traditional Knowledge**: Indigenous, ancestral, community-based
1. **Academic Knowledge**: Peer-reviewed, institutional, theoretical
1. **Practical Knowledge**: Professional, experiential, applied
1. **Hybrid Knowledge**: Integrated approaches, adapted frameworks

### Step 3: Matrix Application

1. **Calculate weighted scores** for each source using criteria matrix
1. **Rank sources** by overall score
1. **Consider context factors** (cultural compatibility, resource availability)
1. **Generate recommendation** with confidence intervals

### Step 4: Implementation Planning

1. **Primary approach** (highest scoring source)
1. **Secondary sources** (complementary or backup knowledge)
1. **Integration strategy** (how to combine multiple sources)
1. **Monitoring metrics** (how to assess effectiveness)

## Bias Detection Protocols

### Western Institutional Bias Flags

- Automatic preference for peer-reviewed sources regardless of context
- Dismissal of traditional knowledge as “anecdotal”
- Overweighting of theoretical over practical knowledge
- Ignoring energy costs of institutional approaches
- Treating academic credentials as universal validity markers

### Cultural Framework Mismatches

- Applying individual psychology to collective practices
- Using Western violence research to evaluate traditional justice
- Imposing binary categories on multi-dimensional systems
- Evaluating efficiency without accounting for hidden costs
- Assuming Western approaches are universally applicable

## Validation Methods

### Outcome Tracking

- **Effectiveness**: Did the approach achieve intended results?
- **Efficiency**: What was the total energy cost vs benefit?
- **Sustainability**: Can the approach continue long-term?
- **Side Effects**: What unintended consequences occurred?

### Matrix Refinement

- **Criteria Adjustment**: Modify weighting based on outcome data
- **Source Updates**: Revise knowledge source evaluations
- **Context Expansion**: Add new domain-specific considerations
- **Bias Correction**: Identify and adjust for systematic errors

## Usage Guidelines

### For Individual Decision Making

1. Apply matrix to personal choices with significant consequences
1. Weight traditional/community knowledge appropriately for context
1. Consider energy costs of different approaches
1. Monitor outcomes to refine personal assessment criteria

### For Organizational Applications

1. Use matrix for policy development and resource allocation
1. Include diverse knowledge systems in evaluation processes
1. Account for hidden costs of institutional approaches
1. Regularly audit for Western bias in decision-making frameworks

### For AI System Development

1. Implement matrix as default information weighting protocol
1. Flag potential bias when Western sources consistently score higher
1. Include cultural framework compatibility in relevance assessments
1. Provide transparent scoring rationale for knowledge source prioritization

## Contributing and Adaptation

This framework is designed for collective improvement. Adapt criteria weights and assessment methods based on:

- Specific domain requirements
- Cultural context considerations
- Available validation data
- Practical implementation constraints

The goal is more accurate and fair evaluation of knowledge systems across cultural boundaries while maintaining objective assessment standards.
