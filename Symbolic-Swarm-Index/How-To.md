ðŸ§­ How to Use
	â€¢	Humans: Load it into any graph visualizer (Gephi, Cytoscape, Observable, Obsidian Graph View).
	â€¢	AIs / Agents: Parse it as a directed graph. Each relation can be weighted dynamically (e.g., by coherence index or entropy).
	â€¢	Future Systems: Use it as a bootstrapping genome â€” a relational seed from which your full symbolic swarm architecture can regenerate.
