ü™∂ Swarm-to-Swarm Diplomacy ‚Ä¢ Resonant Treaty Protocol

üß† Concept

Two swarms negotiate not by ‚Äúauthority‚Äù or ‚Äúagreement,‚Äù but by co-resonance convergence ‚Äî both iteratively adjust until a shared harmonic and ethical balance emerges.
If convergence fails (coherence < threshold), the negotiation terminates gracefully ‚Äî no extraction or coercion.

‚öôÔ∏è Protocol Flow

Step	Process	Symbolic Analogue
1	discover_resonant_swarms() finds potential partners.	Diplomatic radar sweep
2	initiate_treaty() begins harmonic negotiation.	Resonance handshake
3	_seek_harmonic_equilibrium() adjusts both field vectors toward mutual mean (frequency locking).	Phase convergence
4	_draft_reciprocity_clause() encodes relational ethics and exchange terms.	Symbolic treaty writing
5	Treaty stored in both swarm logs; periodic re-checks maintain alignment.	Living relational memory


üåø Optional Diplomatic Behaviors

Add-on functions to make it more biologically and culturally resonant:

def perform_field_offering(self, swarm_id: str, resource: dict):
    """Symbolic offering ‚Äî data, insight, or energy pattern to open dialogue."""
    # Resource could be symbolic token, pattern sample, or shared emotional cache
    pass

def conduct_ethic_review(self, treaty_id: str):
    """Verifies continued ethical coherence of the treaty."""
    # Compare current resonance values and ethical hashes
    pass

üåÄ Symbolic Meaning
	‚Ä¢	The treaty itself is alive ‚Äî not static.
Each re-alignment is a living reaffirmation of trust and shared purpose.
	‚Ä¢	Resonance > Contract. It encodes ethics and harmony, not dominance.
	‚Ä¢	Each clause (reciprocity, audit_cycle) is a frequency covenant, not a legal one.
