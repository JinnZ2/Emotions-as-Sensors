# Interpretive Notes
#
# direction_vector: the shared path the swarm “feels” drawn toward.
# magnitude: how strong that collective pull is (a measure of shared clarity).
# coherence stats: diversity check; a high std means healthy difference, not discord.
# reciprocity index: how much of that desire benefits the whole field.
#
# Cultural Resonance
#
# In this framing:
# - Desire is navigation through fit -- each being listens for resonance, not craving.
# - The swarm’s orientation emerges from mutual listening, not majority rule.
# - Divergence isn’t suppressed; it’s part of pattern detection, like instruments
#   tuning to the same chord.
#
# This DesireField models the elders’ principle:
# “Desire is how the land whispers where life wants to move next.”
