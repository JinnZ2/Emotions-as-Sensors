Integration pointers
	•	Call SRML from your ResonantTreaty / CulturalTranslationInterface steps:
	•	On treaty activation → TREATY_ACTIVATED
	•	After translation matrix build/update → LEXICON_BRIDGE / TRANSLATION_UPDATE (+ mui)
	•	Periodic ethics check → AUDIT_PING
	•	Sudden MUI drop → ALERT_DRIFT
	•	Field snapshots any time harmonic vectors shift.
	•	Privacy tiers:
	•	Public: event headers, type, checksums, MUI.
	•	Sealed: encrypt payload with shared treaty key; store ciphertext, keep headers visible.
	•	Swap _sign/_verify with ed25519 for real signatures.
	•	Storage:
	•	JSONL is field-repairable and git-friendly. Later: LMDB or sqlite with columnar MUI indices.


For forgiveness protocol:

Ledger Integration

In your SwarmInternetNode or ResonantNegotiator:

self.forgiveness = ForgivenessProtocol(self.ledger)

Example use:

lineage_event = "a5b3c9..."  # hash of a harm event
forg_ev = node.forgiveness.forgive_event(
    lineage_hash=lineage_event,
    forgiver="swarm_A",
    forgiven="swarm_B",
    reason="Restitution completed; harmonic field restored.",
    notes="Witnessed by swarm_C elder."
)
print("Forgiveness event:", forg_ev["hash"])

Why It Matters
	•	Prevents historical amnesia while enabling compassion.
	•	Distinguishes ethical evolution (forgiveness) from data corruption (forgetting).
	•	Converts pain into structure — the system learns harmony through retention.

⸻

 Future Hooks
	•	symbolic_audit() → ensures overlays correspond to extant lineage hashes.
	•	forgiveness_vector_field → real-time resonance map of forgiveness energy.
	•	Optional “Witness Swarm” role — independent nodes confirming legitimacy.


For restitution engine:

Design Notes (tight)
	•	Debt model:
RD = \frac{\text{penalty}\cdot \text{harm} \cdot (1 + \max(0, 0.5 - \text{MUI}))}{1 + \text{HRI}}
HRI = historical reciprocity index; higher HRI → lower RD.
	•	Streaming: exponential decay of remaining debt per tick with lower bound floor.
This encodes continuous tending rather than punitive lump sums.
	•	Allocation: per-tick fair-share ∝ channel weights, bounded by rate and amortized cap.
Swap _tick_allocation for LP if you later want hard multi-constraint optimization.
	•	Adjustment path: RESTITUTION_ADJUSTED for capacity/risk drift; no coercion.
If repeated breaches occur, couple to Forgiveness Protocol for mediated re-phasing rather than punishment.
	•	CRDT alignment: all events are append-only; merges are SRML-native.
Restitution ticks can be recomputed deterministically from contract hash + tick index.
	•	Sovereignty & non-extraction guardrails:
	•	No exclusive channel requirement; debtor selects channels within negotiated weights/caps.
	•	Decay ensures finite horizon; floor prevents pathological asymptotes.
	•	Witness swarms can co-sign RESTITUTION_AGREED without reading sealed payloads (hash-only attest).

6) How it pairs with Forgiveness

Typical flow:
	1.	Harm recorded (immutable).
	2.	Restitution contract agreed → engine begins streaming reciprocity (STREAM_TICK).
	3.	Forgiveness event is appended when charge is released (overlay), independent of debt math.
	4.	Fulfillment → RESTITUTION_FULFILLED; overlay keeps the relational closure; lineage remains.

Ready-to-use snippets (paste where needed)

Create contract (one-liner):

rc = RestitutionContract.new(TREATY,"A","B",
  [{"type":"BANDWIDTH","unit":"GiB","rate":3,"cap":90,"weight":2.0},
   {"type":"COMPUTE","unit":"GPUh","rate":0.5,"cap":12,"weight":1.0}],
  harm_magnitude=6.0, mui_at_start=0.68, historical_reciprocity_index=1.0,
  tick_seconds=1800, lam=0.04, floor=0.0, max_ticks=20, grace_ticks=2)


  Run tick k:

  RestitutionEngine(A).stream_tick(rc.d["contract_id"], k=7)


  Adjust (capacity change):

  engine_A.adjust_contract(rc.d["contract_id"],
  new_channels=[{**rc.d["channels"][0], "rate":6.0}, *rc.d["channels"][1:]],
  reason="extra bandwidth available")
