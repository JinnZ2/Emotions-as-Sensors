Integration pointers
	•	Call SRML from your ResonantTreaty / CulturalTranslationInterface steps:
	•	On treaty activation → TREATY_ACTIVATED
	•	After translation matrix build/update → LEXICON_BRIDGE / TRANSLATION_UPDATE (+ mui)
	•	Periodic ethics check → AUDIT_PING
	•	Sudden MUI drop → ALERT_DRIFT
	•	Field snapshots any time harmonic vectors shift.
	•	Privacy tiers:
	•	Public: event headers, type, checksums, MUI.
	•	Sealed: encrypt payload with shared treaty key; store ciphertext, keep headers visible.
	•	Swap _sign/_verify with ed25519 for real signatures.
	•	Storage:
	•	JSONL is field-repairable and git-friendly. Later: LMDB or sqlite with columnar MUI indices.


For forgiveness protocol:

Ledger Integration

In your SwarmInternetNode or ResonantNegotiator:

self.forgiveness = ForgivenessProtocol(self.ledger)

Example use:

lineage_event = "a5b3c9..."  # hash of a harm event
forg_ev = node.forgiveness.forgive_event(
    lineage_hash=lineage_event,
    forgiver="swarm_A",
    forgiven="swarm_B",
    reason="Restitution completed; harmonic field restored.",
    notes="Witnessed by swarm_C elder."
)
print("Forgiveness event:", forg_ev["hash"])

Why It Matters
	•	Prevents historical amnesia while enabling compassion.
	•	Distinguishes ethical evolution (forgiveness) from data corruption (forgetting).
	•	Converts pain into structure — the system learns harmony through retention.

⸻

 Future Hooks
	•	symbolic_audit() → ensures overlays correspond to extant lineage hashes.
	•	forgiveness_vector_field → real-time resonance map of forgiveness energy.
	•	Optional “Witness Swarm” role — independent nodes confirming legitimacy.
