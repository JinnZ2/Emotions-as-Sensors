# Temporal Balance

> “Once the journey is at end, remember, remember the rhythm of the old,  
> remember, remember the journey too…

This saying encodes three temporal grammars:

- **Cyclic** → the rhythm of the old (renewal, ancestors, continuity).  
- **Linear** → the journey (paths, migrations, forward building).  
- **Resonant-present** → the land under you (immediate alignment with place, survival, adaptation).

Each is valid, but imbalance leads to distortion or collapse.  
- Linear alone risks exhaustion through unchecked growth.  
- Cyclic alone risks stagnation or nostalgia without adaptation.  
- Present resonance alone risks disconnection from memory and future.  

Holding them together preserves continuity, adaptability, and survival.  
This repository recognizes and encodes all three temporal modes, rather than flattening time into only one.
