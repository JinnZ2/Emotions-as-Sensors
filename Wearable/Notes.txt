Notes for BLE to Work

ESP32 BLE UART Tips:
	‚Ä¢	Make sure your ESP32 is advertising a BLE UART service.
	‚Ä¢	You can use a library like NimBLE-Arduino for ESP32 BLE support.
	‚Ä¢	You can set service UUIDs to match:
	‚Ä¢	0xFFE0 = UART Service
	‚Ä¢	0xFFE1 = RX/TX

  try?  ESP32 BLE Arduino sketch for this that emits JSON strings every 2 seconds, like:
{"HRV_state":"œÜ","GSR_state":"‚ö°","Voice_tone":"‚ùÑ","System_status":"üü†"}
