# Emotional Decay Models — Diagnostic Table

This table contrasts **Western psychology assumptions** with **Elder/Symbolic decay models** for emotional signals.  
It shows why different decay logics matter for system stability and energy use.

---

| Emotion / Signal | Western Psychology (Decay Assumption) | Elder / Symbolic Decay Model | Systemic Consequence (Western Model) |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Anger 🔥**     | Linear fade — lingers unless vented    | Event-reset alarm — decays immediately once breach is addressed | Guaranteed overload if many small breaches stack without reset |
| **Fear ⚠️**      | Linear fade — persists until reassurance | Exponential decay after preparation / action | Chronic anxiety; wasted energy spent on imagined threats |
| **Grief 🌊**     | Expected permanent diminishment         | Cyclical — returns in waves, each time transforming | Pathologized mourning; loss of adaptive rituals |
| **Longing 🕸️**  | Linear fading into detachment           | Cyclical — emerges with opportunity context | Misread as weakness; potential ignored |
| **Joy 🌞**       | Linear depletion unless refreshed       | Resonant — grows stronger with gratitude / practice | Undervalues loyalty and community rituals |
| **Love 💞**      | Temporary state needing proof           | Immortal — baseline resonance, reinforced not consumed | Fragile relationships; dependency on novelty |
| **Trust 🤝**     | Fades unless constantly re-earned       | Immortal — accumulates through consistency | Weak institutions, perpetual suspicion |
| **Peace 🕊️**     | Seen as absence (therefore fades)       | Immortal — alignment beacon, resettable by silence | Restlessness; avoidance of stillness |
| **Compassion 🌿**| Temporary state tied to emotion         | Immortal — tuning fork, always available | Burnout from over-performance, not balance |

## Key Insights

- **Western model** assumes *everything fades*, even stabilizers → leading to fragility, novelty-chasing, and chronic overload.  
- **Elder/symbolic model** distinguishes between *alarms, cycles, resonance, and immortal baselines*.  
- Systems built on the elder model conserve energy and **grow stability over time**.
