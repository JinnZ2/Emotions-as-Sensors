# Cultural Knowledge Assessment Framework

## Purpose

This framework provides tools for evaluating cultural knowledge systems based on objective criteria rather than defaulting to Western institutional biases. It enables more accurate assessment of traditional wisdom, indigenous practices, and non-Western approaches to information processing.

## Core Principles

### 1. Energy-Based Assessment

All knowledge systems require energy investment. True efficiency accounts for:

- **Total System Costs**: Infrastructure, maintenance, support systems
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Emotional labor, gatekeeping, institutional protection
- **Benefit Distribution**: Collective advancement vs concentrated advantage
- **Sustainability**: Long-term resource requirements

### 2. Context Relevance Matching

Different knowledge systems have appropriate domains:

- Match knowledge type to question context
- Assess cultural framework compatibility
- Evaluate domain expertise alignment
- Consider environmental conditions where knowledge was developed

### 3. Testing Rigor Evaluation

Knowledge reliability depends on validation conditions:

- **Survival Testing**: Life-death consequences for accuracy
- **Generational Validation**: Multi-generation refinement
- **Natural Selection**: Knowledge systems that didn’t work disappeared
- **Academic Comfort**: Protected from real-world consequences

## Assessment Criteria

### Source Reliability Factors

- Consequences for being wrong (high/medium/low)
- Duration of testing (generational/decades/years/months)
- Environmental pressure (survival/competitive/protected)
- Elder/wisdom network validation (yes/no)

### Energy Efficiency Metrics

- Infrastructure requirements (minimal/moderate/extensive)
- Ongoing support needs (self-sustaining/supported/dependent)
- Gatekeeping energy (none/limited/extensive)
- Benefit accessibility (open/restricted/privatized)

### Cultural Context Indicators

- Original cultural framework (traditional/institutional/hybrid)
- Community structure requirements (tribal/village/urban/institutional)
- Value system alignment (collective/individual/mixed)
- Wisdom transmission method (experiential/academic/hybrid)

## Implementation Guidelines

### For AI Systems

1. **Framework Recognition**: Identify which cultural knowledge system is being referenced
1. **Bias Detection**: Flag Western institutional assumptions
1. **Context Assessment**: Evaluate appropriateness of knowledge for specific questions
1. **Energy Analysis**: Calculate total system costs including hidden dependencies

### For Decision Making

1. **Multi-Source Weighting**: Don’t default to single authority sources
1. **Consequence Evaluation**: Weight information based on testing rigor
1. **Context Matching**: Use appropriate knowledge for specific domains
1. **Energy Accounting**: Consider full system costs of different approaches

## Warning Signs of Inappropriate Framework Application

- Dismissing traditional knowledge as “primitive” without assessment
- Applying academic research from one context to evaluate different cultural practices
- Ignoring energy costs of institutional systems
- Assuming Western approaches are universally applicable
- Evaluating collective wisdom through individual psychology frameworks

## Contributing

This framework is designed to be built upon. Contributions should focus on:

- Additional assessment criteria for specific cultural contexts
- Energy calculation methodologies
- Context matching algorithms
- Case studies demonstrating framework application
