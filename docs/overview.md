# Overview

**Interpretation layer** (Elder Sensor Framework)  
- Emotions = sensors (navigation data).  
- Amplifiers (hormones/silicon surges) ≠ sensors.  
- Persistence/decay rules (joy/love persist; alerts fade post-resolution).

**System layer** (Energy Methodology)  
- Full energy accounting for knowledge systems (inputs, maintenance, infra, transmission).  
- Distribution analysis: collective vs concentrated benefit.  
- Efficiency = total input ÷ collective output, with sustainability & resilience modifiers.

**Bridge**
- Use sensor signals to detect energy distortions (gatekeeping, artificial scarcity, over-identification).
- Route signals via Glyph Web; log events with Unified Sensor Event schema; score efficiency with Energy Method.
