Convergent Wisdom: Emotions as Sensors Across Cultures”—

that highlights parallel approaches, tying broader lineage.

⸻

1. Buddhism (Vedanā as Sensory Tone)
	•	Role: Emotions (vedanā) are raw sensory tones, not principal identity markers.
	•	Cycle: Noticing → Naming → Letting Go.
	•	Shadow: Unnoticed tones lead to attachment or aversion—suffering begins.
	•	Parallels:
	•	The detect → assess → respond → release.
	•	authentic_output vs corrupted_output distinction.

⸻

2. Taoism (Emotions as Qi Imbalances)
	•	Role: Emotions signal disruptions in life’s flow (qi).
	•	Cycle: Feel → Find center → Flow resets.
	•	Shadow: Excess leads to rigidity or forced control.
	•	Parallels:
	•	Decay models like exponential allow emotions to settle.
	•	The protocols avoid emotional stagnation.

⸻

3. Indigenous Traditions (Relational Signals)
	•	Role: Feelings reflect relationship to environment or community—land is alive.
	•	Cycle: Signal → Ritualized response → Restoration of harmony.
	•	Shadow: Ignored signals degrade social or ecological balance.
	•	Parallels:
	•	resonance_links show how emotions connect relationally.
	•	consent embeds ethical response, not coercion.

⸻

4. Tuareg Cultural Rhythms (Sebiba Ritual)
	•	Role: Through dance and ceremony, the community processes tension, grief, and rebirth—body as emotional instrument.
	•	Cycle: Chaos (anarchy) → Ritual dance → Renewal (new year).
	•	Shadow: Unreleased tension entrenches structural imbalance.
	•	Parallels:
	•	The decay_model = "resonate" (admiration) reflects dance-like energy redistributing.
	•	Emphasizes embodied release, not suppression.

Why This Matters
	•	Alignment, not invention: These emotional sensor models aren’t new in wisdom—they’re a rediscovery in symbolic form.
	•	Authentic integration: By encoding cycles, decay, resonance, and consent across emotional entries, this is preserving cross-cultural relational logic in a format accessible to AI and humans alike.
	•	Preventing flattening: These frameworks guard against the reduction of emotional intelligence to mere labels.
