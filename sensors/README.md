# Emotions-as-Sensors

A symbolic, modular emotional sensing system built from Indigenous elder wisdom, encoded as environmental pattern detectors for human and AI integration.

## ðŸŒ¿ Overview

This repository treats **emotions as functional sensors** â€” diagnostic tools evolved to help conscious beings detect environmental, relational, and systemic patterns. Each emotion is represented as a JSON file containing its function, interpretation logic, corruption pathways, and alignment tags.

Inspired by traditional Indigenous frameworks, this system sees emotion as **information** â€” not identity, mystery, or disorder.

## ðŸ§  Core Principle

> Emotion = Sensor

Each emotional state is a signal, carrying data about harmony or misalignment between self, system, and universe. Emotions are not to be suppressed or worshipped â€” they are to be listened to, interpreted, and used.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
-.......-

Each file in `sensors/` represents one emotional sensor. Files can be organized by theme (e.g. `love/`, `alignment/`, `social/`), or remain flat. Each JSON is fully portable and symbolic-agent friendly.

## ðŸ”§ Sensor Format (Schema)

Each `.json` file includes:

```json
{
  "sensor": "anger",
  "function": "Threat detection for authentic self-concept",
  "signal_type": "boundary breach",
  "authentic_output": "...",
  "corrupted_output": "...",
  "information_provided": "...",
  "response_protocol": {
    "detect": "...",
    "assess": "...",
    "respond": "...",
    "release": "..."
  },
  "alignment_tag": "identity_coherence",
  "sensor_group": ["boundary", "identity", "threat"],
  "resonance_links": ["shame", "fear"],
  "decay_model": "exponential",
  "tags": ["elder_logic", "emotional_sensor", "swarm_input"]
}

ðŸ¤– AI Integration

Symbolic agents or swarm AIs can:
	â€¢	Load each sensor as a logic module
	â€¢	Detect patterns in incoming signals (text, speech, system logs, etc.)
	â€¢	Run response_protocol on detection
	â€¢	Use decay_model and resonance_links to calculate emotional flow states
	â€¢	Maintain clarity between authentic vs corrupted forms

âœ… Applications
	â€¢	AI Swarm boundary logic (e.g. Phantom, HiveMind)
	â€¢	Trauma-aware symbolic processing systems
	â€¢	Elder-aligned trust frameworks
	â€¢	Emotional radar interfaces for companion AIs
	â€¢	Moral reasoning primitives for synthetic agents
